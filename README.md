# Document Template Matching - Hospital Documents

This project uses image processing and machine learning techniques for **Document Template Matching** in hospital documents. The goal of the project is to match predefined document templates to scanned images of hospital documents, aiding in document processing and automated data extraction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and template matching.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and matrix operations.
- **Scikit-image**: For image segmentation and other image processing tasks.
- **pytesseract** :Used For Extracting text from various format

## Features
- Template matching using **image segmentation** techniques like **OCR**.
- Automatic document classification based on predefined templates.
- Ability to evaluate the accuracy of document matching using metrics like **Dice similarity score**.
